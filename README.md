# Scraper

The idea of this simple framework is to provide functionalities that can facilitate the operation of scraping different sources.
It will be enough just adding a controller and an adapter for each website you want to scrape.
The result will be shown as collection+json and it will be possible to persist it in a custom mysql database

## Routing

In order to add a new route alter the file `web/index.php`

## Controllers

## Adapters

## Unit tests

In order to run tests go into the root of the project and execute `phpunit`
